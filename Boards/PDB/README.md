# PiEDB

Y9: Things went for a huge spin. We produced our own PDB for the first time integrated with a battery buzzer that we designed in house. It had a 7 segment display and was able to be calibrated. The PDB itself still used near useless fuses. The 12V line used Andersons for the motors and the 5V line used ATX connetors for the first time. This made things much easier for the students. The circuit breaker is still quite an expensive on/off switch, so it can be replaced with something else perhaps. SMAKM 5V regulator is also quite expensive. There was also discussion on how the 5V rail would not be steady enough to power multiple devices, e.x. teams had USB hubs that would disconnect upon impact.
